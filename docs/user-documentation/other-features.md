## Django Gateway Theme Management

The CMS takes care fo the gateway home page, child pages content. <br>
Gateways are initially deployed with a common base theme, but the gateway admins can re-brand according to their needs.<br>
In order to change the theme user needs to be in the Admin group.<br>
